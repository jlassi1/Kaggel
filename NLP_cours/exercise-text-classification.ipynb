This function `evaluate` takes a model along with texts and labels. It returns the accuracy of the model, which is the number of correct predictions divided by all predictions.\n\nFirst, use the `predict` method you wrote earlier to get the predicted class for each text in `texts`. Then, find where the predicted labels match the true \"gold-standard\" labels and calculate the accuracy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def evaluate(model, texts, labels):\n    \"\"\" Returns the accuracy of a TextCategorizer model. \n    \n        Arguments\n        ---------\n        model: ScaPy model with a TextCategorizer\n        texts: Text samples, from load_data function\n        labels: True labels, from load_data function\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    # Get predictions from textcat model (using your predict method)\n    predicted_class = predict(model, texts)\n#     print(predicted_class)\n    # From labels, get the true class as a list of integers (POSITIVE -> 1, NEGATIVE -> 0)\n    true_class = [int(i['cats']['POSITIVE']) for i in labels]\n#     print(true_class)\n    \n    # A boolean or int array indicating correct predictions\n    correct_predictions = predicted_class == true_class\n#     print(correct_predictions)\n    # The accuracy, number of correct predictions divided by all predictions\n    accuracy = correct_predictions.mean()\n#     print(accuracy)\n    return accuracy\n\nstep_5.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-22T15:55:54.334791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-22T15:55:54.335239Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.914825Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-22T15:55:54.335194Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.913545Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.16666666666666666, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 2, \"questionId\": \"5_EvaluateFunction\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Correct","text/markdown":"<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Correct</span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n# step_5.hint()\n# step_5.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.916130Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.916431Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.920524Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.916402Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.919441Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"accuracy = evaluate(nlp, val_texts, val_labels)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.921785Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.922136Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-22T15:56:00.474649Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-22T15:55:57.922105Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-22T15:56:00.473602Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Accuracy: 0.9486\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the functions implemented, you can train and evaluate in a loop.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This may take a while to run!\nn_iters = 15\nfor i in range(n_iters):\n    losses = train(nlp, train_data, optimizer)\n    accuracy = evaluate(nlp, val_texts, val_labels)\n    print(f\"Loss: {losses['textcat']:.3f} \\t Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-22T15:56:00.475857Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-22T15:56:00.476133Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-22T16:36:08.634663Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-22T15:56:00.476107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-22T16:36:08.633528Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Loss: 4.498 \t Accuracy: 0.945\nLoss: 3.108 \t Accuracy: 0.946\nLoss: 2.348 \t Accuracy: 0.944\nLoss: 1.929 \t Accuracy: 0.945\nLoss: 1.591 \t Accuracy: 0.945\nLoss: 1.345 \t Accuracy: 0.944\nLoss: 1.131 \t Accuracy: 0.942\nLoss: 1.004 \t Accuracy: 0.941\nLoss: 0.900 \t Accuracy: 0.939\nLoss: 0.845 \t Accuracy: 0.943\nLoss: 0.695 \t Accuracy: 0.938\nLoss: 0.651 \t Accuracy: 0.938\nLoss: 0.645 \t Accuracy: 0.938\nLoss: 0.591 \t Accuracy: 0.938\nLoss: 0.553 \t Accuracy: 0.936\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 6: Keep Improving\n\nYou've built the necessary components to train a text classifier with spaCy.
